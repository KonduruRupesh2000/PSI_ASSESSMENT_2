1)Create a Scala program to reverse, and then format to upper case, the given

code:

object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val str="https://www.google.com"
    val revstr=str.reverse.toUpperCase()
    println(s"output=$revstr")
  }
}

2) Create a Scala program to output the following basic JSON notation.

Code:

object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val donutName = "Vanilla Donut"
      val quantityPurchased = 10
      val price = 2.50
      val donutJson =
      s"""
         |{
         |"donut_name":"$donutName",
         |"quantity_purchased":"$quantityPurchased",
         |"price":$price
         |}
      """.stripMargin
  println(donutJson)
  }
}

3)Create a Scala program to prompt customers for their name and age. The format for the name and age labels should be in bold. And, the name literal should be underlined.

code:

    import scala.io.StdIn._
    val name = readLine("Enter your name: ")
    println("Enter your age: ")
    val age = readInt()
    println(Console.BOLD)
    print("Name: ")
    print(Console.UNDERLINED)
    print(name)
    println(Console.BOLD)
    print("Age: ")
    print(Console.RESET)
    print(age)

4)Create a Scala program to find the 8th character in the String: "http://www.google.com".

code:

object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
     val str = "http://www.google.com"
    val charToFind = str.charAt(7)
    println(s"The 8th character literal in $str = $charToFind")
  }
}



5)Create a Scala program to calculate the total cost for a customer who is buying 10 Glazed donuts. You can assume that the price of each Glazed donut item is at $2.50.
 Notice the format of the $25.00 total cost literal, which is essentially at 2 decimal places.

code:

object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val glazedDonut = "Glazed Donut"
    val unitPrice = 2.50
    val qtyPurchased = 10
    val totalCost = qtyPurchased * unitPrice

    println(f"""Total cost of $qtyPurchased $glazedDonut${if (qtyPurchased > 1) "s" else ""} = $$$totalCost%1.2f""")
  }
}

6)Create a Scala program that will ask the following question to a customer: "What is your favorite movie of all times?".

code:

import scala.io.StdIn._
object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
     
    val favoriteMovie = readLine("What is your favorite movie of all times?")
    println(s"$favoriteMovie is totally awesome!")
  }
}

7)Assume the following lexical coupon codes: "A", "BB", "CCC", "DDDD", "EEEEE". Write a Scala program to create a new set of coupon codes based on the above one.
 The format for each coupon code should be as follows: "coupon code - i", where the number i is derived from the length of each corresponding coupon code.

code:

object Interval{
    def main(args:Array[String]){
        val coupons= Seq("A","BB","CCC","DDDD","EEEEE")
        var count=0
        for(i<-0 to 4){
            var couponLen=coupons(i).length
            var coupon=coupons(i)
            println(s"$coupon - $couponLen")

        }
    }
}

8)Create a Scala program to represent a List with a sequence of number from 100 to 150.
 You should omit the last numeric item of 150, and each numeric item should have a 10 numeric interval. You should then calculate the sum of all the numeric items in the List.

Code:

object Interval {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val list=List.range(100,150,10)
        val listSep=list.mkString(", ")
        println(s"Elements of List from 100 to 150, Excluding 150 = $listSep")
        println(s"sum of numbers ${list.sum}")
  }
}
